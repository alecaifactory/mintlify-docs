### Team Roles

| Role | Package Access | Organization Management |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Full access to all packages | ✅ Add/remove members, manage packages |
| **Developer** | ✅ Install/use private packages | ❌ Limited management access |

## Publishing Workflow

<Note>
All publishing should use automated scripts to ensure proper access control.
</Note>

### Automated Publishing (Recommended)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Version Manager
# Bump version and publish both packages
./version-manager.sh bump minor --publish
```

```bash Publishing Script
# Publish both packages with proper access control
./publish-npm-packages.sh both
```

```bash Dry Run
# Test publishing without actually publishing
./publish-npm-packages.sh both --dry-run
```
</CodeGroup>

### Manual Publishing

<Warning>
Manual publishing should be avoided. Use automated scripts to prevent access control errors.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```bash Public Package
cd pame-cli
npm publish    # Uses publishConfig: { "access": "public" }
```

```bash Private Package
cd pame-core-cli
npm publish    # Uses publishConfig: { "access": "restricted" }
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Cannot install private package">
    **Error**: `403 Forbidden - you do not have permission`
    
    **Solutions**:
    ```bash
    # Check authentication
    npm whoami
    
    # Login with organization member account
    npm logout && npm login
    
    # Verify organization membership
    npm org ls @pameai
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Contact organization admin if you're not listed as a member.
    </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Published with wrong access level">
    **Problem**: Package published as public instead of private (or vice versa)
    
    **Solution**:
    ```bash
    # Unpublish incorrect version
    npm unpublish @pameai/package@version
    
    # Republish with correct settings
    npm publish    # Will use publishConfig
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Be careful with unpublishing. It can break dependencies.
    </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team member cannot access private package">
    **Problem**: Team member gets 403 error when installing
    
    **Admin Solution**:
    ```bash
    # Add member to organization
    npm org add @pameai team-member
    ```
    
    **Team Member Solution**:
    ```bash
    # Refresh authentication
    npm logout && npm login
    npm install -g @pameai/core-cli
    ```

- ✅ **Automated Publishing**: Use scripts to prevent access control errors

### Team Management

```bash
# Regular member audit
npm org ls @pameai

# Remove former team members
npm org rm @pameai <former-member>

# Monitor package usage
npm view @pameai/core-cli --json
```

### Publishing Security

- ✅ Always use `publishConfig` in package.json
- ✅ Test with `--dry-run` before actual publishing
- ✅ Verify package access after publishing
- ✅ Use automated version management scripts
